*integration system for neuro-rehabilitation*

I started publishing sources. I am cleaning up the code base in this process, so this all will happen gradually.


## python
- testcontroller.py: a supervisory application 
- testproducer.py: a data stream source
- testconsumer.py: a data stream sink

## web
- a javascript controller
- a javascirpt consumer with realtime plot
